# repositoryAnalysis

To run this application, clone/checkout the source code from git and then run the following command in the project folder

- python securityCheck.py path_to_dir (where path_to_dir: is the directory under investigation such as a project directory)

- Updated the project so that it runs a simple http server that is now accessible on http://localhost:8080. To kill the server, simply CTRL+X on the terminal where the script was run.

- Also note that the application generates "results.json" and "results.txt" file with all the results of possible compromised files.
